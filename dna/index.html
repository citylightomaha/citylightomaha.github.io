            <h4>The Citylight Family Mission</h4>
            <p>The mission of Citylight is to multiply Jesus’ disciples and churches.</p>
            <h5>We Believe.</h5>
            <p>We believe church planting is God’s primary way of advancing the gospel!</p>
            <p>We believe the best way to make disciples and mature disciples is by planting new churches. New disciples are made as new networks and communities are engaged by a new local churches. New leaders are surfaced, trained and empowered as churches are planted. Existing disciples are matured through church planting because people are called to serve, give and trust Jesus in grater ways. These existing disciples will grow in their Christ-likeness as they live in community and begin living on mission</p>
            <p>We believe God has called us to plant churches in the Omaha Metro area for the good of this city and the glory of God.</p>
            <h5>Our Vision.</h5>
            <p>We dream of the day, when every corner of our city will have a gospel-centered, Jesus exulting, Spirit-led church family committed to worshiping King Jesus and serving our community.</p>
            <p>We dream of a family of churches that will work together to engage our city, serve the poor, train leaders and committee themselves to church planting.</p>
            <p>We dream of a movement that is slow enough to care for everyone in our church families and fast enough to reach Omaha with the gospel.</p>
            <p>We dream of thousands of people meeting Jesus, being baptized, and joining the mission of the church.</p>
            <p>We dream of an Omaha that is known around the world as a place where a movement of God is changing the city.</p>

                    <p>The gospel is the “good news” that God has reached down to us in his son, Jesus, to defeat sin and death and their effects in our world. Through his life, death, and resurrection, Jesus has initiated and accomplished what we never could. This gospel is the “power of God” (Rom. 1:16) to overcome the penalty of sin (past) the power of sin (present) and the presence of sin (future). It is the power for personal salvation and transformation as well as the renewal of neighborhoods, cities, and nations. We never move past Jesus. We never move past the gospel. Who we are and what we do will be rooted in and empowered by God’s reaching down in the gospel.</p>

                    <h6 class="center"><b>UP | FORMATION</b></h6>
                    <p>We have all been formed into a certain kind of person. The goal of the gospel is not just to save us from hell, but to renew our character and lives “until Christ is formed in you” (Gal. 4:19). We are committed to proclaiming the gospel not just as the front door to Christianity but as the good news that we live by every day. We are committed to being a church that drives people to personal repentance and faith in Jesus for a changed and transformed life.</p>

                    <h6 class="center"><b>IN | COMMUNITY</b></h6>
                    <p>The church is not a place but a people. It’s not just a weekly assembly of individuals, but a community committed to loving each other well and doing life together. Community is the context for gospel formation and mission. We will not settle for being a weekly service for people to attend, but will continually drive people to share their lives with others as “a people for [God’s] own possession” (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>

                    <h6 class="center"><b>OUT | MISSION</b></h6>
                    <p>The church IS God’s missionary agency to fulll the great commission. Emil Brunner wrote, “The church exists by mission as a fire exists by burning.” Therefore, “missions” is not one ministry within the church, but the very orientation of the church. The same gospel that transforms us also compels us outward on mission. We exist as a church on mission to be “a city on a hill” and “the light of the world” (Matt. 5:14). We are committed to living as a scattered church during the week in City Groups and as a gathered church on Sunday as our City Groups come together.</p>

            <h4>Gather & Scatter</h4>
            <p><b>CITY GROUPS | (SCATTER).</b> City Groups are the heart of Citylight Church. Multiplying City Groups is our goal. They are not an optional program or a seasonal Bible study. We want everyone in the church to participate in a City Group. A City Group is a mid-sized community (15-40 people) that is growing as a spiritual family, being transformed by the gospel, and serving a specic neighborhood or network of Omaha. City Group leaders focus the rhythms of the group around three things: formation (up), community (in),and mission (out). We envision City Groups that are small enough to care for each other’s spiritual formation and big enough to dare to engage the culture around them. As disciples multiply at Citylight, so will City Groups and churches.</p>
            <p><b>SUNDAY GATHERING I (GATHER).</b> Sunday gatherings are a gathering of City Groups. Just as Christians have been doing for 2,000 years, Citylight will gather on Sundays to celebrate Jesus’ resurrection, proclaim his word, worship him through music, and celebrate the Lord’s Supper and baptism. Sunday gatherings will serve the broader mission of multiplying disciples and churches. As our gatherings equip disciples and inspire the ministry of City Groups, new churches will be planted.</p>

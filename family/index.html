            <h4>Join Our Team!</h4>
            <h5>Internship</h5>
            <p>We are always looking for the right people and interships are a great way to get talented, humble, high character people on board. Interns don’t make coee at Citylight but instead are given ownership to help lead at all levels of our church.</p>
            <h6>Why Intern at Citylight?</h6>
            <p><b>Develop Ministry Competencies.</b> We look to develop interns by giving them real ministry reps and responsibility. You will be teaching, leading, connecting with people, writing and actually doing things that matter.</p>
            <p><b>Develop Theologically.</b> We want to equipping you to think rightly and deeply about God. To be a disciple is to be a “learner” and will help develop you trough encouraging grad school or Citylight school.</p>
            <p><b>Develop Your Character.</b> All of us are in process and at Citylight you will have a pastor who is overseeing your ministry responsibility, giving you feedback and helping you take next step in regards to your personal holiness and humility. We are not looking to just train you to do ministry but want to see Christ formed in you.</p>
            <p><b>Impact others.</b> As an intern you will have a chance to make an eternal impact in the lives of other. Maybe that is developing college students, or investing in our kids ministry or caring about the poor in our city…. I don’t know what God is calling you to do, but Jesus has used our interns to make disciples and mature existing disciples.</p>
            <p><b>Fun.</b> We have a culture of celebration, joy and fun. We dance as a sta team to 90’s rap, do push ups together, and spend lots of time telling stories of how God is at work. We are committed to do ministry with people we love and having lots of fun.</p>
            <h6>How Do Interns Get Paid?</h6>
            <p>Citylight church pays a portion of the intern’s salary, but the intern is required to raise part of their salary. Citylight, also covers health care expenses and has funds available for seminary or graduate level training.</p>
            <h6>What Areas Do You Offer Internships?</h6>
            <p>Currently, we have 8 full time interns helping to give leadership to our college, youth, worship, groups, kids and community engagement ministries. Basically, if you’re the right person, there is probably room for you on the team.</p>
            <h6>How Long is the Internship?</h6>
            <p>Citylight Internships are full time and last two years. After the two years, some interns will be invited to remain on sta, others will be sent out to serve at other local churches and others may discover they want to work outside of the local church.</p>

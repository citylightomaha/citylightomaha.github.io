    <h1>Our Planting Strategy</h1>
    <p>We desire to plant multiple "daughter churches" in the next 5-10 years that share our name, core values, disciplship, structures, and denomination affiliation.</p>

      <h4>The Need for Church Planting</h4>
      <h6>The U.S.</h6>
      <p>Between 1990 and 2006, the population of the US grew by 52 million. In that same 16-year period, there was no growth in church attendance. From 1999 to 2005, 52% of protestant churches declined in attendance.</p>
      <h6>Nebraska</h6>
      <p>Between 2000 and 2005, the population of Nebraska grew by 47,524 but the percentage of the population attending an evangelical church on any given weekend fell 4.1%. The reality is that as our population grows, the reach of the American church has largely plateaued.</p>
      <h6>Omaha</h6>
      <p>Between 2010-2014 the Omaha metro area grew by ten percent. During this same period of time, mainstream Christian denomination saw almost no growth in church attendance. Omaha needs more churches to keep up with the growth of the city, and more churches to reach a greater number of residences with the gospel. Currently, local churches are not keeping up with the growth of the city, let alone taking new ground spiritually.</p>
      <p>Between 2000-2012 those who consider themselves to have no religious aliation grew by thirty ve percent. We need new churches, to engage new people groups and new areas of our city with the Gospel.</p>
      <p>As the Omaha metro quickly approaches 900,000 people, there is an immediate need for the planting of new, indigenous, culturally-relevant, healthy evangelical churches to reach emerging populations in our city. There are many great churches in Omaha that are doing a good job of engaging people with the gospel. But as the population grows, a church mindset of addition will only leave us losing ground. We have to start thinking multiplication – making disciples that make disciples and planting churches that plant churches.</p>

      <h4>How does Citylight plant new Churches?</h4>
      <h3>Pray</h3>
      <p>We don’t have a five year plan to plant new churches. We don’t know where the next church planter will come from, or how God will provide a gathering place. We do know what God has called us to and we believe God will call leaders into the mission of planting new churches. We will commit ourselves to be a prayer movement before we strive to be a church planting movement. We will pray for laborers, provision, vision and leading. We don’t want to simply try and execute a good idea, but we want to hear from heaven, be lead by the Spirit of God and join Him in His redemptive work!</p>
      <h3>Launch City Groups.</h3>
      <p>City Group’s are a critical component to church planting. By launching city groups in neighborhoods throughout Omaha, we are empowering lay leaders to live on mission in their local context. Many of these city groups will grow and multiply into new groups. These city groups are capable of growing into church planting core teams. When planting Citylight Benson, we identied that we had a number of healthy, disciple making, missional city groups in specic location. Those city group leaders were already investing deeply in their community and were eager to help bring a new local church to their community. City group multiplication proceeds church planting. We must, continue to launch, equip and coach city groups.</p>
      <h3>Develop Leaders.</h3>
      <h5>City Light School</h5>
      <p>The Citylight School provides theological and leadership training to existing and emerging leaders within our church and community. The CS is taught by local seminary professors, business leaders and pastors. Classes cover a wide variety of topics but will be focused on helping equip city group leaders, future elders and church planters for the work of ministry. We will teach classes on preaching, incarnation living, new testament theology etc.</p>
      <p><a href="http://citylightschool.org/">Check out Citylight School</a></p>
      <h5>Citylight Internship Program</h5>
      <p>Citylight is committed to raising up church planters and pastors. To do this, we offer a two year internship which provides interns with real ministry responsibilities, allows interns to experience our staff culture and gives them on going coaching, encouragement and feedback. This is a full-time internship program for college graduates.</p>
      <p><a href="#">Citylight Internship Application</a></p>
      <h5>Citylight Church Planting Residency</h5>
      <p>This role is for an existing ministry leader or pastor who may join our sta team for 12-24 months before planting a new church. This person would be given real ministry responsibilities, would be given the chance to preach once a month, lead a city group, coach leader and work to secure resources, build a core team and develop a prospectus.</p>
      <h3>Sending Our Best.</h3>
      <p>We are committed to sending our best. When we identify a church planter, we allow them to take anyone on our sta team, elder board or in our church. We are committed to sending our best, saying “Gospel Good byes” and to being open handed. Church planters will not be sent out with JV teams but with some of our most committed, trained and proven people. Also, want to send church planters with a core team of 150-200 committed people.</p>
      <h3>Pay it Forward.</h3>
      <p>Citylight received nancial support from people, churches and our denomination. We now want to generously pay forward that grace and those financial resources. We believe existing church plants should be nancial antonymous from the beginning, but we want to help send each church plant out with nancial resources</p>

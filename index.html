    <h4>Family of Churches?</h4>
    <p>Our desire is to create a "family of churches" with the same vision and DNA. In light of that desire, we want to give the Citylight surname to all of our future daughter churches. Citylight has a positive image in the city of Omaha and we believe that preserving the name will give us more church-planging momentum.</p>

    <h4>Common Questions</h4>
    <p>Daughter Churches? What do you mean by planting a “daughter church” and how does it dier from a traditional multi-site and autonomous church plant?</p>
    <p>A multi-site church is one church that meets in multiple locations. They share the same vision, DNA, mission, budget, and sta. They fall under the leadership of the central campus and are centrally resourced. The benet of starting a multi-site church is that it allows you to launch a church quicker, creates a leadership vacuum for leaders to be raised up, share overhead expenses and resources, and preserves a sense of unity and accountability. The downsides to the multi-site model may include lower ownership and dependence on the main campus.</p>
    <p>Traditional autonomous church plants dier from multi-sites in that they receive blessing and armation from a sending church and are launched with their own vision, sta, preaching team, and budget. The benet of starting an autonomous church, as in Citylight’s case, is that it allows you to have a high level of ownership from the beginning. The downsides to planting autonomously may include a higher risk of failure, lack of support and resources, and having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
    <p>As we have studied Scripture, assessed our currently reality, and taken sta inventory into consideration, we have decided to plant “daughter churches” that will move towards full autonomy. This means, from the beginning, Citylight church plants will have its own budget, core team, advisory team, and unique missional focus.</p>
